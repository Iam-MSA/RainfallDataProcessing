# Rainfall Data Processing

This project demonstrates the creation and consumption of rainfall data using Java I/O. It includes two main classes: `RainfallDataCreator` and `RainfallDataConsumer`. The `RainfallDataCreator` class generates a rainfall data file, while the `RainfallDataConsumer` class reads the file, computes the average rainfall, and displays the data.

## Features

- Create a rainfall data file with station name, district, and daily rainfall readings.
- Read the rainfall data file, display the data, and compute the average rainfall.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher installed
- Java IDE or text editor

### Usage

1. Clone the repository:
